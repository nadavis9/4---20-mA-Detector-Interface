# 4---20-mA-Data Aquisition System
This project was designed by group 2 of the Pitt ECE Senior Design class of December 2021 in collaboration with the Naval Nuclear Laboratory. The purpose of this project was to provide students with an opportunity to design a system based upon real life systems used in NNL's labs. Having access to accurate data and reliable instrumentation in a convenient, timely manner is key to NNL's success. All of their lab processes use 4 - 20 mA instrumentation systems to remotely monitor and control chemical processes. With the help of several engineers at NNL, my group was able to design a 4 - channel data aquisition system modeled off of the ones used in NNL's actual labs. *Note - this design was not intended for actual use by NNL. Rather, it served as an opportunity for students to tackle a challenging problem encountering many companies across this industry.* Included in this repo, is all of the embedded software used to support the data aquisition/processing, user interface, and wireless data transmission for this project. A summary of our design is shown below, including references to all of the relevant files in this repo and what they were developed for. 

Shown in Figure 1, is a block diagram of our complete system prototype.
